# SS TP1 Cell Index Method

This program was build with Java and JFrame (for the observations)

In this TP, there must be a `Static.txt` file to run the program. This file must only contain numbers, spaces or  some particular characters like `.` and `e`.

The `Static.txt` file has defined elements that must appear in different rows and in this particular order, that is explained below:

- `L`: the size of each side

- `N`: the amoutn of particles to generate.

- `r_c`: the radio of interaction

- `M`: the value used to generate the amount of cells.

- `r`: (optional) the radius for all the particles.

If `r` is not defined, the radius for each particle will be between `0` and `0.25`.

The particles will be generated in a `Dynamic.txt` file.
